# In case you forget how to re-deploy the BL RoR app, here are some reminders.
#
# NB: someday the process can and should be fully automated.
#
# For now, it requires some human intervention:
#
# * The illumination install.sh script requires three Y responses from the keyboard at the moment.
# * Two "secrets" may need to be set explicitly.
# * This then entails re-running the migrations.
# * We are using symlinks to link various directories to permanent locations (runtime dir, logs, sqlite db)

# this is the 'root directory' for the the RoR apps and versions of apps
cd ~/projects

# redeploy PAHMA BL to search_pahma; suggest using a deployment directory name based on date, e.g. sYYYYMMDD
./illumination/install.sh pahma s20180505 ~/projects/django_example_config/pahma/config/pahmapublicparms.csv

# at the moment, a little more manual tweaking is required...
cd s20180505/
# on dev and production, the created log and sqlite db should be removed and
# a link made to the "permanent" directories
# (local dev install do not need to do this, of course)
rm -rf log/
ln -s /var/log/blacklight/pahma log
# link the db directory to the "permanent" db directory
rm -rf db
ln -s /var/blacklight-db/pahma db

# there are two secret keys needed. the first must be set as an env var for production.
# this has been done in .profile for the blacklight user.
# the second will copy the first if not provided.
# or you can edit the following two files if you want to set them yourself.
# vi config/secrets.yml
# devise seems to need editing too...
# vi config/initializers/devise.rb

# we still need to do a migration to support production mode (the 'bundle install')
bundle install
export RAILS_ENV=production
rake db:migrate
cd ~/projects

# link the new dir as 'search_pahma' (passenger, etc. expects it to be this directory)
# apache should probably be stopped ad this point, though it's not clear it matters...
# you'll be restarting it after this step anyway.
./relink.sh s20180505

or

ln -s s20180505 search_pahma

# run under passenger, if you like, or start/restart apache
export RAILS_ENV=production
passenger start
