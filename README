There are no real instructions for this customization.

To install the "PAHMA demo", try the following, no guarantees:

* clone or fork the GitHub repo
* execute the very ad hoc install script. caveat emptor!
* start the server
* see if it works

e.g. to install in your home dir (the only place I've tried it):

cd
git clone https://github.com/jblowe/illumination.git
# you will be asked one question. answer y
./illumination/install.sh pahma my_app
cd ~/my_app
rails s

then visit:

https://localhost:3000 in your browser.

To stop the server, type ^C (control-c) in the terminal window where you started the server.
